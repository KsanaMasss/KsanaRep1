Feel free to change things up a bit here to fit your familyâ€™s needs. Not big fans of spice? 
We do recommend keeping the green chilis for flavor, but you can easily lessen or eliminate the chili powder. 
Want a (slightly) more health-conscious meal? Swap the beef for ground chicken or turkey, and the white rice for brown. 
Tip: Be aware, brown rice will take longer to cook, and you will likely need to add additional liquid, so keep an eye on it. 
Once down, feel free to serve this meal completely on its own, or alongside tortillas for a hearty burrito filling. 

If you manage to have any leftovers, store in an airtight container in the fridge for around 3 days. Made this?
